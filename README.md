# Snake-Game
I learned how to create this game while taking the "GUI Development with Python and Tkinter" certification class on Udemy. The object of the game is to direct the green
snake with the arrow keys on your keyboard towards the purple food without hitting into the edge of the canvas. Everytime the green snake "eats" the food, it grows in
size and you gain one point. The more points you gain, the faster the green snake moves which increasingly makes the game more difficult. The game was created using
object oriented programming in Python with function definitions that control specific events.
